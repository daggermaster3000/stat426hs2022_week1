## Generate Negative Binomial Distribution

The library [MASS](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/rnegbin.html) can easily generate random outcomes from a Negative Binomial distribution.

To ensure the simulated is consistent, random seed can be called by `set.seed(123)`

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)

library(MASS)
x <- rnegbin(n = 100, mu = 10, theta = 2)
```

## Create a histogram

```{r}
set.seed(123)

library(MASS)
x <- rnegbin(n = 100, mu = 10, theta = 2)
hist(x, main = "Histogram (linear)")
hist(log(x), main = "Histogram (log)")
```

## Reporting simulated data

The mean from simulation is `r mean(x)` and the variance is `r var(x)`
